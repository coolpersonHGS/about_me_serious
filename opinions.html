    <h3> If the universe is truly infinite, aliens are real and we will probaly never meet them physically. </h3>
   

    <h3> We technically see everything in the past, because light takes time to travel.</h3>
   
    
    <h3> We also technically have lag in real life, because it takes time for us to realize and ackowledge what our sense detect/notice <br>(nothing is instant)</h3>
    
    <h3> I ideally want to be able to make video games for a living when I grow up</h3>
