    <h1> Shows that I think are epic which are quite epic</h1>
    
    <h3> Number 100: Mob Psycho 100</h3>
    <p> The show is pretty funny, and it also has its moments. <br> W character development</p>

    <h3>  Number 2: Brooklyn 9-9</h3>
    <p> pretty cool show, pretty cool ending. Its a comedy about police officers I think</p>
    
    <h3> Number 3: jujutsu kaisen</h3>
    <p> Season 2 was very sad    =[</p>

    <h3> honorable mention: The Boondocks</h3>
